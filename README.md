- 👋 Hi, I’m @PivalIT
- 👀 We provide application support for PiVAL International, a logistics and warehousing provider based in Quebec, Canada, but with facilities extending across the country.
- 🌱 We're currently learning what the best way to manage our custom code infrastructure is, and we think GitHub is a great tool for that!
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate with our customers and our trading partners to facilitate deeper, more seamless integrations between our technology platforms.
        We want to make things as easy as possible, and help make PiVAL a preferred choice in the supply chain.
- 📫 How to reach us ... reach out to one of our members directly:
        Dan Bowey, Business Integration Analyst - dbowey@pival.com
        Paul Martin, Director of IT - pmartin@pival.com
